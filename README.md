<h1>Online Banking/ATM Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project implements a simple online banking system using the class 'BankAccount'. The 'BankAccount' class represents a bank account with attributes such as the account holder's name, password, and account balance.

The class provides several methods to perform basic banking operations.

The 'withdraw()' method allows the user to withdraw funds from their account. It prompts the user to enter their password and the withdrawal amount. If the password is correct and the account has sufficient balance, the specified amount is deducted from the account balance, and a success message is displayed. Otherwise, appropriate error messages are shown.

The 'deposit()' method enables the user to deposit funds into their account. It also requires the user to enter their password and the deposit amount. If the password is correct, the amount is added to the account balance, and a success message is displayed.

The 'print_account_info()' method allows the user to view their account information. It prompts the user to enter their password. If the password is correct, it displays the account holder's name and current balance.

The program initializes an instance of 'BankAccount' with the account holder's name and password. It then enters a loop where the user is prompted to choose between depositing or withdrawing funds. Once a valid option is selected, the corresponding method is called, and the loop is exited. Finally, the account information is displayed using the 'print_account_info()' method.

This project provides a basic framework for online banking functionality and can serve as a starting point for further enhancements and integration with a more comprehensive banking system. It emphasizes the importance of password verification for secure transactions and provides a way for users to interact with their account and perform common banking operations.
